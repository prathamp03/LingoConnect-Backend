# LingoConnect

## Project Overview

**LingoConnect** is an innovative video hosting platform created specifically for speech therapy, catering to the needs of children who experience speech misarticulation. This platform aims to establish a dedicated and supportive environment for both therapists and users, ensuring that resources are effectively tailored to meet the challenges associated with speech disorders.

## Problem Statement

In India, a significant number of children face challenges related to speech misarticulation, which can adversely affect their communication skills and self-confidence. General platforms like YouTube often present a vast array of unrelated content, making it challenging for parents and therapists to locate specialized resources. LingoConnect addresses this issue by providing a centralized platform where users can easily access content exclusively focused on speech therapy.

## Key Features

- **Therapist-Focused Content**: Licensed therapists can upload and share videos that specifically address various speech issues, helping users to find relevant information without the distractions of unrelated content.

- **Community Interaction**: LingoConnect promotes engagement between therapists and users through features such as comments and likes, fostering a supportive community. A dedicated section allows therapists to post updates and connect with their audience.

- **Intuitive User Interface**: The platform is designed with user experience at the forefront, offering straightforward navigation that makes it easy for users to discover and interact with content.

- **Secure User Authentication**: To protect user privacy and security, LingoConnect implements a robust authentication system, allowing safe access for both therapists and users.

- **Subscription Options**: Users have the ability to subscribe to their favorite therapists, ensuring they receive notifications about new content and encouraging ongoing engagement.

## Technology Stack

The backend of LingoConnect is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that enables the creation of scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: A web framework for Node.js, tailored for developing APIs and web applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that provides flexibility in data storage and management for user and video information.
- **Cloudinary**: A cloud-based service for managing media assets, facilitating smooth video uploads and streaming.
- **Multer**: A middleware that simplifies the handling of multipart/form-data, primarily for file uploads.
- **MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines**: Employed for executing complex queries and data processing tasks efficiently.
